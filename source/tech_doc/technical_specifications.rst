Additional Notes
----------------

1. **Payload:**
   - Maximum payload refers to the peak capacity the arm can lift momentarily.
   - Continuous payload is the recommended capacity for sustained operations.

2. **Repeatability:**
   - The robot can consistently return to the same position with an accuracy of less than 1 mm, making it ideal for precision tasks.

3. **End Effector Compatibility:**
   - The DynaArm is compatible with ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 standard flanges, allowing easy integration of custom tools or grippers.

4. **Protection Rating (IP66):**
   - The robot is protected against dust and powerful water jets, ensuring reliability in industrial environments.

.. note::
   Some specifications, such as power consumption, are currently under evaluation and will be updated in future revisions.
