Risk Assessment
===============

This risk assessment was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in EN ISO 12100, ISO 10218-1, EN 60204-1, and EN 61000-6-2/6-4, which provide structured approaches for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with machinery and industrial robots. The assessment aims to ensure that all identified hazards are mitigated to an acceptable level, prioritizing inherent safety, technical protective measures, and user information.

Hazards
-------

**1. Crushing Hazard from Joints**

- **Description:** Moving parts can cause crushing injuries.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Protective covers at critical points.
    - Limitation of movements (e.g., torque restrictions).
- **Residual Risk:** Minimal

**2. Unsafe Integration**

- **Description:** Improper installation into the larger machine may create risks.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Provide detailed installation instructions.
    - Include guidelines for safe integration and remaining risks.
- **Residual Risk:** Minimal

**3. Contact with People Due to Movements**

- **Description:** Movements of the robot may lead to contact with people if safety distances are not maintained, potentially causing injuries.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Define and enforce safety distances in the installation manual.
    - Add warnings for safe operation.
    - Implement speed limitations.
    - Use smooth acceleration and deceleration profiles.
    - Include an emergency stop mechanism.
- **Residual Risk:** Minimal

**4. Excessive Force or Speed**

- **Description:** Uncontrolled forces or speeds during operation may pose a safety risk. Currently, the robot can limit force and speed via software, but integrated safety mechanisms are not yet implemented, which might limit the reliability of these measures in certain conditions.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Implement software limits for force and speed based on ISO 10218-1 requirements.
    - Monitor and control forces in real time.
    - Include hardware-based safeguards to limit force and speed in future versions.
    - Clearly communicate to users that safety-critical applications require external validation and safeguards.
- **Residual Risk:** Moderate

**5. Lack of Safety Modes**

- **Description:** Operating without dedicated safety modes (e.g., maintenance or programming) may expose operators to risks.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Introduce a low-power mode for maintenance and programming.
    - Ensure safety modes are clearly documented and accessible.
    - Prevent operation in unsafe conditions through interlocks.
    - Note that comprehensive safety mode implementation is planned for future iterations.
- **Residual Risk:** Moderate

**6. Electrical Safety**

- **Description:** Electrical components and wiring may pose risks such as electric shocks, short circuits, or overheating if not properly managed.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Ensure proper insulation of all cables and components.
    - Install fuses or circuit breakers for overcurrent protection.
    - Provide grounding for all electrical parts to dissipate dangerous voltages.
    - Clearly label all electrical components and switches.
    - Use cable management systems to protect wiring from physical damage.
    - Include an easily accessible emergency stop switch.
- **Residual Risk:** Minimal

**7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)**

- **Description:** Electromagnetic interference (EMI) may cause malfunction of the robot or disturb nearby devices. EMC compliance has not yet been verified through formal testing.
- **Mitigation Measures:**
    - Users must ensure installation in environments with low electromagnetic noise.
    - Shield cables and sensitive electronic components where possible.
    - Use filters or suppressors to reduce potential conducted and radiated emissions.
    - Inform users that the product has not been tested for EMC compliance and recommend additional external validation for critical environments.
- **Residual Risk:** Moderate
