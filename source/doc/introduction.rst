Introduction
============

The DynaArm is an innovative robotic arm designed for high precision, flexibility, and integration into diverse applications. It combines advanced hardware with modular software to deliver powerful performance for research, industry, and prototyping.

Unique Features
---------------

- **Exceptional Weight-to-Force Ratio:** The DynaArm offers unparalleled performance by maximizing force output while minimizing weight, making it ideal for precision tasks.
- **Direct Drive Actuation:** The use of direct drive motors provides high efficiency and eliminates the need for transmission components, enabling seamless and precise movements.
- **Backdrivability:** This unique feature allows the arm to move freely when force is applied externally, offering enhanced safety and adaptability in collaborative setups. (Backdrivability refers to the ability of a robotic joint to be physically moved by an external force without resistance, crucial for responsive and safe interactions.)

Applications
------------

While the DynaArm is designed for industrial applications, its initial focus is on research and development due to its prototype status. Potential use cases include:

- **Research:** Testing new algorithms and motion control strategies in academic or industrial labs.
- **Prototyping:** Developing proof-of-concept systems for manufacturing or robotics applications.
- **Education:** Demonstrating advanced robotic principles in a controlled environment.

Development Status
------------------

**Important Note:** The DynaArm is currently in the development phase and is not a finished product. It has not undergone final safety testing or received CE certification. Use is intended for research and development purposes only, and users are responsible for ensuring safety during operation.

Disclaimer
----------

Duatic is not liable for damages or injuries resulting from improper use of the DynaArm. Users must take all necessary precautions when operating or integrating the system into their setups.
